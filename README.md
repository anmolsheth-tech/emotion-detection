# Emotion-detection


This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect human emotions from facial expressions in real time. Trained on the FER-2013 dataset, the model classifies faces into seven categories: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised. It leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a webcam feed to demonstrate practical computer vision capabilities in mental health and human-computer interaction contexts.
